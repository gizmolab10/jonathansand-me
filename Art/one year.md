A few years back, my stoner buddy Bruce challenged me to spend an entire year on one piece. It'll be your masterpiece, he claimed. It was a fun year.

Copious details, continuously morphing into each other. Looking closely at those tiny shapes feels good to me. As I follow them around, through their kinks and along their long stretches, no matter how many times, feels fresh and interesting.
