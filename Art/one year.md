A few years back, my stoner buddy Bruce challenged me to spend an entire year on one piece. It'll be your masterpiece, he claimed. It was a fun year.

I like it, happy that it holds that entire year. Feels good to me to look closely. Copious details, continuously morphing into each other. It continues to feel fresh and interesting. As I follow them around, through their kinks and along their long stretches. Does my heart good to know I crafted well.

He took these photographs. His capture of color and shadow is a hoot. I like the variety of moods.
