I feel better when I am working on a sculpture. Curious to see what it will look like after I do a thing to it. Fight against the clay when it is too soft or too hard. Some things take forever.

I am not really saying anything with art. That's the reason I do it. Each is a journey from some random gloppy shape of wet clay, along a path that feeds my curiosity, to an assortment of small regions surrounding an approximation of that original gloppy shape. Textures, technique, tools, type of clay, always changing.
