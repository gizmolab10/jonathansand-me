# What's my life really about?

During high school, I would walk at night with a friend of mine, maybe a hundred blocks each time. We talked, really welcome and deep stuff. It was obvious to us then, that we children were being conditioned to a certain kind of life; and we didn't like that, it wasn't something we had consented to. We vowed to resist it.

A few years later, adult life struck. Those molding forces got stronger and came from everywhere, as I tried to fit in, earn my living, get my shit together. After a few more years, I forgot about that oath and applied myself to being normal. Buy a house, get insurance, explore all the available consumer goods, vote, read and stay in touch. Life grew complex because I let it, not realizing I had a choice about that.

My earning potential has always fluctuated. In my slow periods, my friends noticed I was not being frugal and told me. I listened and pulled myself together some more, bringing my cost of living way down. It was then that the effects of being conditioned became apparent to me: purchase of things I wanted but did not really need, life goals that were ultimately meaningless. My vow all those years ago started to take effect and I felt this tremendous desire to play.

Now I can ask myself some intriguing questions. Does work have to be dull and hostile? Can we make it fun? What stops us all from taking advantage of the abundant fruits of civilization? Is optimism practical? Is trust of each other damned important? Who can I play with and ask?

Lately, I feel a clear headed passion for my species, and have resolved to make something meaningful of the rest of my life in aid of us all. I am convinced we blundered into a gawdawful mess and are intelligent enough to wrench ourselves free.
