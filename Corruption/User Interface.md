# Our User Interface

Ultimately our UX must be easy to both learn and use. These are both difficult goals. Not impossible, especially when thought through early and deeply. Some principles are worth considering:

2. quick responses to every user action
3. allow user to control the quantity and quality of information being presented
4. use only a few easy to learn glyphs that represent data
