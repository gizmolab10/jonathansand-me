# Nursery

Lacking time and funds with which to keep up on my gardening, it grew out of control. Recently Chris and I have been clearing out the overgrowth, revealing lots of bare dirt on which to start over. Excited about this, Bruce and I visited a nearby wholesale nursery and grabbed a couple dozen perennials. In this page I share three of them. On the [[2025|next page]], some older plantings.
