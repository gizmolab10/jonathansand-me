# Homeless in California
If you are homeless, you need a patch of grounded to sleep on, nearby facilities for expressing yourself, some source of nutrition and occasional health assistance. Obviously, the cost of this is supposed to come out of thin air.

# Encouraging Benevolence
# Ethics and Money
I wonder if we could identify one single problem the solution to which would be more impactful than anything else. We could have a contest and accept project proposals.

My proposal is simple to say, unfathomably hard and I think would serve mankind and the planet more than anything else. Goal: introduce ethics deeply into our monetary system. Make every transaction require an ethical sensibility.

Cutting down forests would likely not be as common as it now is, in close relation to our growing global need for them.
