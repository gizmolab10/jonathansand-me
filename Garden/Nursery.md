# Nursery

Lacking the time and funds with which to keep up on my gardening, it grew out of control. Recently Chris and I have been clearing out the overgrowth, revealing lots of bare dirt on which to start over. Excited about this, Bruce and I visited a nearby wholesale nursery and grabbed a couple dozen perennials. Here are three of them.

The tallest stalk is over six feet high and about three inches in diameter, growing about one foot a day! Luscious pale purple pink.
