# Nursery

Lacking the time and funds with which to keep up on my gardening, it grew out of control. Recently Chris and I have been clearing out the overgrowth, revealing lots of bare dirt on which to start over. Excited about this, Bruce and I visited a nearby wholesale nursery and grabbed a couple dozen perennials. Here are three of them.

## Old Growth
My garden changes throughout each year and year by year. Here are a few established plants captured at their best.

The tallest stalk is over six feet high and about three inches in diameter, growing about one foot a day! Piercing force. Luscious pale purple pink.

## Magnolia magnifolia
The leaves and flowers are over a foot in size. The seedpod is yellow during the bloom and purple with orange seeds when ripe.

The tree itself shot straight up as it grew, sending out a few short, almost perfectly horizontal branches. Years went by. Then it began to flower. It's now about 40 feet tall with several dozen flowers. Each flower lasts about three days. The one captured here is on day 2.

I hear this species is as old as the dinosaurs.
